# ⍨ Hi! ⍨ #

I think about computers a lot. I am currently working on:

- 🌱 [<code>ELSIE</code>](https://github.com/smoynes/elsie): a virtual machine for the LC-3 educational computer.
- 🤖 messing with microcontrollers.
- 🗒️ my manifesto on computing. <blockquote><samp>The information revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.</samp></blockquote>



In addition to computing, I like:

- 📘 reading
- 🚶 walking
- 🚴 cycling
